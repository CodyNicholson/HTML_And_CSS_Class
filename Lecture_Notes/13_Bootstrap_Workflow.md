# Bootstrap Workflow Basics

Make sure you have bootstrap.css and bootstrap.min.js in the head of your project

A row should be of class "row"

An item in a row should be of class "col-md-X" where X is an integer 1-12 that will decide how many 12ths of the screen wide your row will occupy

For images, use the "img-responsive" class to give all your images responsive attributes defined in the bootstrap.css file
