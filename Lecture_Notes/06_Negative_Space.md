# Negative Space

Negative space is space that does not contain anything, like margins and padding

Padding adds white space around the element

Margins add white space next to the element that is not a part of it

Everything inside of the border in the box modal is a part of the web element

You can find the box model for an element by inspecting the element using devTools in google chrome
